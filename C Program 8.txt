INPUT:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int a,b;
  float c;
  a= 5;
  b= 2;
  c= a+b;
  printf("Sum of %d and %d is %.2f\n", a,b,c);
  c= a*b;
  printf("Product of %d and %d is %.2f\n", a,b,c);
  c= a/b;
  printf("Integer Division of %d by %d is %.2f\n", a,b,c);
  c= (float)a/b;
  printf("Real Division of %d by %d is %.2f\n", a,b,c);
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Sum of 5 and 2 is 7.00
Product of 5 and 2 is 10.00
Integer Division of 5 by 2 is 2.00
Real Division of 5 by 2 is 2.50
